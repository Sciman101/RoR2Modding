# Overpolypd
This mod gives players the option to configure how Squid Turrets work to make them more powerful and generally useful!
Features include:
- Ability to make squid turrets use player items, similarly to engineer turrets
	- Toggleable blacklist for items that would normally be disabled for engineer turrets
- Ability to disable squid turret health drain

Right now, items won't appear stuck to the turret properly, which I'll probably address in a future patch - it doesn't affect gameplay at all, though.

Changelog
------------
1.1.0 - Fixed another typo in the README, added configuration options for the squid turrets, and added blacklist for banned engineer turret items
1.0.2 - Fixed a bug that broke the whole damn thing right after I uploaded it here
1.0.1 - Fixed typo in README.md
1.0.0 - Initial release

How to Install
------------
Make sure you have [BepInExPack](https://thunderstore.io/package/bbepis/BepInExPack/ "BepInExPack") and [R2Api](https://thunderstore.io/package/tristanmcpherson/R2API/ "R2Api") installed first, then just place the mod file in the Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\plugins folder.
